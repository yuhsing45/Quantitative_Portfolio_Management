# Quantitative_Portfolio_Management
The objective of the this project is twofold: 
1) to build a factor-based model allocation called a Long/Short Global Macro Strategy with a Target Beta, and 
2) 2) to evaluate its sensitivity to variations of Beta as well as its sensitivity to the length of the estimators for covariance matrix and the expected returns under different market scenarios(including the pre-subprime crisis period, the crisis period (2008), and the post-crisis period.
